approach: "<h4 id='approach'>Our Approach</h4><hr><div class='panel'><p>Each year, over one million students drop out of college. The largest single reason for this is the cost of higher education. Currently, less than 15 percent of low-income students will graduate from college. The above statistics are not due to a lack of talent, but rather due to the high cost of tuition. Every student in the United States deserves a chance to attend college.  We believe that a proper education helps build strong character inspiring young people to bring creativity, leadership and generosity to whatever their future holds.</p><p>Affording college is a major source of anxiety for many students and their families.  Despite sacrifices made on behalf of many parents to provide an education for their children, often they cannot shoulder the entire cost alone.  We are funding scholarships to increase education opportunities for those most in need.  We plan to expand access to higher education for low income students and to promote community service and leadership as well.  We view this as an extraordinary opportunity to make an immediate, significant difference in the lives of those less fortunate.  These scholarships will ensure that fewer children, especially one whose family is caught in a financial emergency, will be denied the benefits of an education.</p></div>"
